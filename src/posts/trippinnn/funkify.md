# Funkify

Learned about [Funkify](https://www.funkify.org/) in a recent accessibility workshop and Iâ€™m *actually* blown away. This tool simulates different types of disabilities *in the browser*â€”from dyslexia to low vision to motor challengesâ€”and itâ€™s such an eye-opener.

With the [EU Accessibility Act](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202) around the corner, there's been a ton of buzz (and pressure) on getting a11y rightâ€”and honestly, it's about time.

Iâ€™ve been deep diving into accessibility since the start of the year and Funkify has been one of the most impactful tools in helping me *feel* the friction real users experience.  
If you're a dev, designer, or just curious humanâ€”give it a spin. Itâ€™s wild in the best way.

Also, if you're looking to level up your accessibility dev toolbox, I put together a bunch of fun & powerful a11y tools in this post:

Stay curious. Stay kind. Stay **#trippinnn** ðŸŒ€
