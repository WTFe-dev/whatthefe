# ls-lint: File & Folder Naming, Sorted!

In the wild west of frontend development, everyone seems to follow their own rules‚Äîone team prefers `camelCase`, another swears by `PascalCase`, and then there‚Äôs that one dev who names files like `randomStuff/ComponentFolder` or `main_file.tsx`. **The inconsistency is real!** Sure, we‚Äôve got tools like `eslint` to wrangle variable names and formatting, but when it comes to file and folder naming? It‚Äôs a lawless land with no sheriff in sight.

Navigating a large codebase shouldn't feel like deciphering ancient scripts. Enter **ls-lint**‚Äîthe tool you never knew you needed, but now won‚Äôt be able to live without!

## What is ls-lint?
[ls-lint](https://ls-lint.org) is a blazing-fast file and directory name linter that enforces naming conventions, ensuring your project structure remains consistent and organized. This is especially valuable in enterprise environments where multiple teams work on projects within the same tech stack.

## Why ls-lint is a Game-Changer?

- **Enforce naming** ‚Äì Works for directory and file names - all extensions supported - full Unicode support.
- **Easily target extensions** - Apply rules to specific file types while ignoring others.
- **Simple setup** ‚Äì Minimal setup with simple rules managed in one single or multiple `.ls-lint.yml` files.
- **Performance** ‚Äì Super fast, running instantly on even large projects.
- **Agnostic support** ‚Äì Works with any programming language‚Äî`React, Next.js, Go, Java`, or anything else.


Checkout all the features ‚Äì [Official docs](https://ls-lint.org/2.3/getting-started/introduction.html#key-facts).

## How to Use ls-lint?

### 1. Create a .ls-lint.yml file

Your ls-lint configuration should be located in a `.ls-lint.yml` file in your project root directory. This file provides two main options:

- **ls:** Defines the structure of your project directories, specifying rules for extensions, sub-extensions, and directories.
- **ignore:** Allows you to exclude specific files and directories from the linting process.

<br />

```yaml
ls:
    ...

ignore:
    ...
```

<br />

### 2. Setting up the rules

Here are some example rules to standardize how `React` components are structured. This configuration ensures consistency in the `src/components/` folder using standard glob patterns.

```yaml
ls:
  src/components/*/:
    .dir: PascalCase
    .module.scss: PascalCase
    .tsx: PascalCase
    .test.tsx: PascalCase
    .ts: camelCase

ignore:
  - node_modules
```

#### **Rules:**

- **`.dir: PascalCase`** ‚Üí All directories must follow PascalCase.
- **`.module.scss: PascalCase`** ‚Üí SCSS module files must use PascalCase.
- **`.tsx: PascalCase`** ‚Üí React component files (.tsx) must follow PascalCase.
- **`.test.tsx: PascalCase`** ‚Üí Test files (.test.tsx) must also use PascalCase.
- **`.ts: camelCase`** ‚Üí Regular TypeScript files should be in camelCase.


::: tip
###### Tip
Instead of using `PascalCase`, you can define your own patterns using `regex`. Read more about the rules [here](https://ls-lint.org/2.3/configuration/the-rules.html).
:::



#### **Ignored Files**

- The `node_modules` directory is completely ignored by `ls-lint`.


#### Examples

Here are some quick basic examples of good and bad naming conventions for a `Foobar` React component. More examples with different rules are [here](https://github.com/giri-jeedigunta/wtfe.dev/blob/main/docs/ls-lint/rules-example.md)

‚úÖ **Good:**
```
src/components/Foobar/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Foobar.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Foobar.module.scss
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Foobar.test.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
```
<br />

‚ùå **Bad:**
```
src/components/foobar/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foobar_component.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foobar_component.test.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Index.ts
```

<br />

When we run `npx ls-lint` from the root, the bad example doesn‚Äôt match the expected rules, `ls-lint` will show the below errors:

```
ERROR: "src/components/foobar" failed for .dir rules: PascalCase
ERROR: "src/components/foobar/foobar_component.tsx" failed for .tsx rules: PascalCase
ERROR: "src/components/foobar/foobar_component.test.tsx" failed for .test.tsx rules: PascalCase
ERROR: "src/components/foobar/Index.tsx" failed for .ts rules: camelCase
```

<br />

## **Cons of ls-lint?**

Every great tool has its drawbacks, and `ls-lint` is no exception. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

- **YAML-Only Configuration** ‚Äì Unlike ESLint, which supports JS and JSON formats, `ls-lint` only uses `.yml` for configuration. This may feel less familiar or convenient for frontend developers used to JSON-based tooling.
- **No Custom Error Messages** ‚Äì Unlike tools like [`eslint-plugin-check-file`](https://github.com/dukeluo/eslint-plugin-check-file), `ls-lint` does not support custom error messages. This means you're limited to its default error outputs, which can sometimes be harder to interpret.

<br />

And there you have it‚Äî**ls-lint, the sheriff your file names didn‚Äôt know they needed! ü§†**

No more chaotic file names, no more endless debates in code reviews. Set your rules, run `ls-lint`, and let it handle the nitpicking‚Äîso you can focus on building cool stuff.
