# Genesis - The WTFe Moment

Every blog has an origin story—this is mine.

I love writing about the stuff I work on, but let’s be real **—time and priorities have always been the boss battle**. But now? **We’re in the era of AI**. One night, just as I was about to crash, a wild idea hit me like a rogue segfault.

**AI could take care of all the boring, mind-numbing tasks, while I dive headfirst into the wild, unpredictable, and insanely fun creative madness?**

Boom 💥. Neurons fired 🧠. Sparks flew ⚡. And in that moment, **WTFe happened—like a glitch in The Matrix.**

Do I know exactly what I’ll write? **Nope**. Do I know how much time I’ll commit? **Also nope**. But that’s the fun part—I’ll figure it out as I go, and maybe, just maybe, some of you will be part of the madness too. 😉

## Tech stack
For once in my life, I wanted **NOTHING** to do with React, Next.js, SASS, or any of that “enterprise” stuff—that’s my day job. This blog? This is my playground.

I wanted to write whenever inspiration struck—whether I was on my laptop, my phone, or some ancient relic of a computer at my grandma’s house. **No setup, no build times, no excuses**.

So, the choice was easy: **Markdown**.

No fancy frameworks. Just plain text, ready to go, anywhere, anytime. After digging around for inspiration, I landed on [11ty + Markdown](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/markdown/)—and suddenly, it felt like I was back in my college days, hacking away in raw HTML and stacking CSS like a mad scientist. Old-school, retro, and refreshingly simple.

And honestly? **I don’t mind re-living those days for a change**.

So that’s it. **WTFe?!**
