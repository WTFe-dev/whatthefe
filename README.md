# WTFe.dev

Welcome to the WTFe.dev! This is where frontend, AI, and chaos collide. Here's a quick guide to get you up and running locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   In your project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
   yarn install
```

2. **Run the Development Server**
Once the dependencies are installed, start the local development server with:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:8080
